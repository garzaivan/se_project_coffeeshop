This is my second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the designs brief. As you navigate through the page, you'll be able to view delicious recipes on how to make a homemade Mexican espresso, and a homemade cappucino. You'll be able to book a table and check out the great selection of items that we sell at the coffee shop. A treat for your eyes and taste buds! Enjoy!

## Project features

- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transformations (circle pulsate) on the "About" section
- Smooth Transitions to the pages nav links, book a table button, and the social media links

## Plan on improving the project

I think making sure the videos should be updated to the briefs specifications to help follow along. The project was fun and challenging which is always good when learning a new skill. One thing I would add to the page would be a little more animation to the buttons, links and even logos, make them pop out and expand in scale as you hover over them. People love attention grabbing graphics.
